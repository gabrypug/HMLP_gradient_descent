# Hypercomplex Multilayer Perceptron (HMLP) with gradient descent algorithm and Learning-on-Learning Method

This repository contains all the C/C++ source code for the implemanation of the Hypercomplex Multilayer Perceptron (HMLP) with gradient descent algorithm and Learning-on-Learning Method used in the paper ...

## How to compile the main example

From terminal: 

`cd <HMLP_FOLDER>`

`g++ ./*.cpp ./Q/*.cpp - o <EXACUTABLE_NAME> -lpthread`
